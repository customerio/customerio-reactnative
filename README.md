# Customer.io React Native SDK

This is the official Customer.io SDK for React Native.

You'll find our [complete SDK documentation at https://customer.io/docs/sdk/react-native](https://customer.io/docs/sdk/react-native/). This readme only contains basic information to help you install and initialize the SDK.

## Install and initialize the SDK

1. Open your terminal and run `npm install customerio-reactnative`
1. Add iOS dependencies to your project by going to the iOS subfolder and running `pod install`. 

   Make sure your deployment target is set to at least 13.0. Before you perform this step, you may want to update your podfile to support [APNs and/or FCM push notifications](https://customer.io/docs/sdk/react-native/push/#install-the-push-package) and [rich push](https://customer.io/docs/sdk/react-native/rich-push/#rich-push) respectively.

1. For Android, include [google-services-plugin](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/google-services-plugin) by adding the following lines to the project-level `android/build.gradle` file:  
      ```groovy
      buildscript {
         repositories {
            // Add this line if it isn't already in your build file:
            google()  // Google's Maven repository
         }

         dependencies {
            // Add this line:
            classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:<version-here>'  // Google Services plugin
         }
      }

      allprojects {
         repositories {
            // Add this line if it isn't already in your build file:
            google()  // Google's Maven repository
         }
      }
      ```

1. Add the in-app dependency to the `dependencyResolutionManagement` block in your `android/settings.gradle` file—if it exists. Otherwise, add the dependency to your project-level `android/build.gradle` file.
   ```groovy
   // in build.gradle
   allprojects {
      repositories {
         // add in-app messaging dependency
         maven { url 'https://maven.gist.build' }
      }
   }
   ```

1. Add the following line to `android/app/build.gradle`:
   ```groovy
   apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'  // Google Services plugin
   ``` 
1. Download `google-services.json` from your Firebase project and copy the file to `android/app/google-services.json`.

1. Return to the main folder and run your application:
   * **iOS**: `npx react-native run-ios`
   * **Android**: `npx react-native run-android`

1. Add an import statement to your project for the react native library. We haven't included it below, but you can import `CioLogLevel` to set log outputs to something other than `error`; this may help you debug your application.
   ```javascript 
   import { CustomerIO, CustomerioConfig, CustomerIOEnv, CioLogLevel, Region } from 'customerio-reactnative';
   ```
1. In `useEffect`, initialize the package with your `CustomerioConfig` options and `CustomerIOEnv` variables. You can find your Site ID and API Key credentials—or create new ones—under *Data & Integrations* > *Integrations* > *Customer.io API*:
   ```javascript
   useEffect(() => {
      const data = new CustomerioConfig()
      data.logLevel = CioLogLevel.debug
      // In-app messages are optional and disabled by default
      // To enable in-app messages, set enableInApp to true
      data.enableInApp = true

      const env = new CustomerIOEnv()
      env.siteId = Env.siteId
      env.apiKey = Env.apiKey
      // Region is optional, defaults to Region.US. Use Region.EU for EU-based workspaces.
      env.region = Region.US

      CustomerIO.initialize(env, data) 
   }, [])
   ```
