# Updates the RN SDK in the sample app during SDK development. Great for testing changes to the SDK in the sample app.
#
# Usage: 
# cd apps/APN/ # make sure you run this script from the root directory of the sample app. 
# ../../scripts/dev:update.sh
# 
# It's recommended to add this to the package.json of the sample app:
# "scripts": {
#   "dev:update": "../../scripts/dev:update.sh"
# }
# Then, you can run `npm run dev:update` to be easier. 
#
# Note: 
# This script assumes the sample app is using npm, not yarn. yarn has a caching 
# mechanism that makes it difficult to update the SDK from a local install. 
# https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/5357 

# change directory to where you are executing the script from, not the directory where the script is located in.

mv customerio-reactnative-*.tgz customerio-reactnative.tgz # rename the .tgz file to a more predictable name. This is so our sample apps do not need to update the package.json file and can instead continue to use the same local file path for the "customerio-reactnative" package.
